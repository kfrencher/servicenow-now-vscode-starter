## Enable project level errors from eslint
The extension is linting an individual file only on typing. If you want to lint the whole workspace set ```eslint.lintTask.enable``` to ```true``` and the extension will contribute the eslint: lint whole folder task. There is no need to define a custom task in tasks.json.

## Enable project level typescript errors
Set ```typescript.tsserver.experimental.enableProjectDiagnostics``` to true to enable project level errors from typescript
```json
"typescript.tsserver.experimental.enableProjectDiagnostics": true
```

Copy the contents of this folder to the root of the ServiceNow workspace. It should overwrite the corresponding folders in the workspace created by the ServiceNow plugin.
